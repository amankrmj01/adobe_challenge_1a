# Round 1A Approach: Structured Outline Extraction

## Objective
To accurately extract the title and hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3) from any given PDF document, outputting them in a clean, structured JSON format. This forms the foundational understanding of the document's content.

## Methodology
Our approach utilizes **pdfplumber** for robust text and layout analysis. The process is systematic:

### 1. Font Feature Analysis
- First, analyze font sizes and boldness properties across the document.
- This helps dynamically identify characteristic font styles associated with different heading levels.

### 2. Adaptive Heading Detection
A hybrid strategy is employed to identify headings:

- **Rule-Based Filtering:**  
  Rigorous heuristics filter out common non-heading elements such as page numbers, table of contents entries, overly long lines, or sentences ending with punctuation.

- **Regex Pattern Matching:**  
  Regular expressions are primarily used to robustly capture structured, numbered headings (e.g., "1. Introduction", "2.1. Sub-section").

- **Font-Based Fallback:**  
  For unnumbered headings, their prominence is inferred using the dynamically determined font size thresholds and bold styling.

### 3. Title Identification
- The document's title is typically identified as the largest, most prominent text on the first page.

### 4. Post-processing
- Extracted outlines undergo a deduplication process to ensure accuracy and conciseness.
